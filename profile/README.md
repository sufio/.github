## We are Sufio 👋

Sufio is a professional invoicing solution with Python at its core. We’ve built a reliable Shopify app to help ecommerce businesses worldwide, making it easier for them to create and send compliant invoices automatically. The team is proud to be trusted by successful brands like Herman Miller and Kurzgesagt.

As a SaaS company, we aim to scale with our customers using tools like Docker and Kubernetes while continuing to build new features for upstart stores. A clean, efficient codebase is valuable to us, so we've kept maintenance in our development sprint cycle in order to minimize technical debt.

If you want to become part of a small team of Python enthusiasts and learn about other technologies like React, reach out at jobs@sufio.com. No need to be formal—just shoot us a short paragraph about you, and we’ll be happy to chat.
